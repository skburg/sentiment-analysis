Much of the word embeddings code is from code that Stuart Owen Axelbrooke shared in his "A Brief History of Sentiment Classifiers" presentation to the NLSEA Meetup on 4/8/2019 https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/events/259884581/

The reviews.csv file with the movie review data was too large to easily upload to Github.
crawl-300d-2M.vec is 4.5 GB. It should be easy to find and download online.
